# ChatGPT Console Bot
ChatGPT presents an artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI that can respond to requests online. OpenAI provides an API that allows us to embed ChatGPT bot interaction into our application

We need a token to send requests. It can be generated in your personal account on the openai website at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

After clicking on the "Create new secret key" button, a window will be displayed with the generated token, which must be copied and saved. This token is then displayed in the key list and can then be deleted at any time.

After receiving the API KEY, replace the string "ENTER-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE";
